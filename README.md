## Exploratory Data Analysis ##
- Performing exploratory data analysis to find preliminary insights such as data patterns.
- Checking assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations of online course-related data sets such as course titles, course genres, and course enrollments. 
- Then extracting a word-count vector called a “bag of words” (BoW) from course titles and descriptions. The BoW feature is probably the simplest but most effective feature characterizing textual data. It is widely used in many textual machine learning tasks. 
- Finally, you will apply the cosine similarity measurement to calculate the course similarity using the extracted BoW feature vectors.
